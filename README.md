Weather App 

Description:

I have created Weather App that gives the current weather information for any city entered by the user. It also predicts the weather for the next 5 days in a 3 hour interval for a city entered by the user. I have used OpenWeatherMap API Free Services Tier for the same. 






Technologies Used:
HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Javascript, JQuery, JSON




Process to run the code:

1. Download the "weatherapp" folder from the "coding-project" repository.
2. Open the "index.html" file using any web browser present inside the "weatherapp" folder.
3. You can start using the app on your local machine.
